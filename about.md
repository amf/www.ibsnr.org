Until January 2011 the member countries of the Nordic Region were Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. 
January 1st 2011 the Nordic Region and the Baltic Group joined into the Nordic-Baltic Region. We have made new [by-laws](IBSNBR_By-Laws.pdf) after the merge. The regional board will now shift between the Nordic and Baltic countries in the following order;  Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway/Iceland, and the Baltic countries as one group.

As effective from 1 January 2009 and according to the traditions the regional board of the Nordic Region has shifted from Finland to Norway and the following officers were elected in the ballot in 2008:President: Geir Egil Eide, Centre for Clinical Research, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen (elected for 2009-12). Secretary: Anne Marie Fenstad, Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen (elected for 2008-12)Treasurer: Ågot Irgens, Department of Occupational Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen (elected for 2008-12).The board constitutes the IBS Nordic Regional Committee together with the national representatives:Denmark: Jens Henrik Badsberg (Copenhagen), Estonia: Krista Fischer, Iceland: Birgir Hrafnkellson (Reykjavik), Lithuania Riamanatas Eidukevicius, Norway: Magne Thoresen (Oslo),Sweden: Mikael Anderson (Uppsala) and, the Nordic representative of the General Council of IBS: Tom Britton (Sweden). Latvia has no national representative for the moment.

The countries take turns every second year in leading the Region.
