The International Biometric Society is an international society promoting the development and application of statistical and mathematical theory and methods in the biosciences, including agriculture, biomedical science and public health, ecology, environmental sciences, forestry, and allied disciplines. The Society welcomes as members statisticians, mathematicians, biological scientists, and others devoted to interdisciplinary efforts in advancing the collection and interpretation of information in the biosciences. The Society publishes two journals, Biometrics, reporting communications consistent with the Society's mission, and, jointly with the American Statistical Association, the Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics.

The Society is organized into geographically-defined Regions, each with at least 50 members, and smaller National Groups, each with at least 10 members. The Society is governed by an Executive Committee of General Officers and a legislative Council representing the international diversity of the membership. Regions and National Groups elect their own officers and governing boards.
